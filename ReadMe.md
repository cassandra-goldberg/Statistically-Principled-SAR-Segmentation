This respository contains the code for my Honors Project conducted at Bowdoin College. The project is focused on leveraging known statistical properties of SAR to enhance deep learning algorithms for SAR image segmentation. It contains code for generating synthetic SAR data, deep learning architectures that incorporate statistical moment computations, and loss functions that incoporate the Euclidean distance between the average pixel values of the perceived regions.
