# Statistically-Principled Deep Learning for SAR Image Segmentation
This respository contains the code for my Honors Project conducted at Bowdoin College. The project is focused on leveraging known statistical properties of SAR to enhance deep learning algorithms for SAR image segmentation. It contains code for generating synthetic SAR data, deep learning architectures that incorporate statistical moment computations, and loss functions that incoporate the Euclidean distance between the average pixel values of the perceived regions.

Note: You must run the synthetic data code (and save the data) before running the other experiments. You must run and save the models in order to test them.
